NEXT GOAL:

Want to make the layouts more organic based on themes:;

if the user sets a forest theme it should be more twisting nad windy

castles should be more organized and structured

caves should be more organic and chunky, some narrow paths but more openly large areas

also need to fix a bug with player positioning, player should always try and face the nearest opening

After this, level chaining, we need the player to be able to go to an exit, click on it, loading screen plays, next level,

once player "dies" or reaches the end (kill the boss on level 10) the game ends
